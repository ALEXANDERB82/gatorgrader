# GatorGrader

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/),
GatorGrader is an automated grading tool that checks the work of programmers and
writers. Although it can be used independently of a project, GatorGrader is
commonly used by faculty in the [Department of Computer Science at Allegheny
College](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science) as a Git submodule in a
Git repository for a specific assignment. Since it is a Python 3 program that
can easily be run on the command-line, GatorGrader also works nicely with
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).
